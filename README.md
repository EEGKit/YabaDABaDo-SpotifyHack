# YabaDABaDo-SpotifyHack
Hello!

Welcome to our Junction 2017 hack!

We (very proudly) built this in a team of 2 over 30 hours!

If you'd like to ask any questions or chat about this please feel free to message us!

There are 2 parts to this project:
	An adapted SDK to read the brain data and format it to be readable by the web interface.
	A web dashboard to retreive and process data from spotify and run our comparison algorithm to match playlists to a mood!

Install is simple:
'npm install' and then 'node app.js'

Run the brain scanner (EPOC compatable)
